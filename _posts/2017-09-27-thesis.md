S Corporations are generally small businesses with limited number and types of shareholders. An S Corporation’s profits or losses are passed through to its shareholders. Shareholders of S Corporations report their business profit or loss on their tax returns. A recent study by Kelly Luttrell shows that for the tax year 2003, S Corporations accounted for 61.9 percent of the 5.4 million corporate returns filed. S corporation return filings have increased by 36.3 percent since 1997. S Corporation is the most selected legal tax treatment structure based on the same study.
<p>
This thesis is a cross-sectional study of S Corporations revenue and U.S. real GDP over the course of 10 consecutive years, ranging from 2004 to 2013. 
<p>
The real GDP statistic data from 2004 to 2013 was collected from the Bureau of Economic Analysis, U.S. Department of Commerce’s reports and Interactive Data application. The S Corporations tax statistics data from the tax year 2004 to 2013 was collected from the Statistic of Income’s publications of the Internal Revenue Service, U.S. Department of Treasury.
<p>
The IRS Statistics of Income’s sample design type is a probability sampling and a stratified sampling method was used for sample selection. The target population consists of all returns of active S Corporations that filed the Form 1120S to IRS from the tax year 2004 to 2013.
The researcher compiled statistical data based on the Statistics of Income’s sample design and used the quantitative analysis to find the results of this study.
This study reports that S Corporations revenue accounted for 40.19 percent of U.S. GDP over time.  
<p>
This finding concludes that S Corporation is the major contributor to the U.S. GDP over time, even though it is a small business per tax treatment perspective.
S Corporation spends an average of 2.57 percent of its revenue for rent expense over time. This is not a significant percentage. The finding shows that the majority of the S Corporation does not rent a property. However, S Corporation may own the property and claims depreciation. Future research should be conducted to analyze the Depreciation expense of S Corporation from the same IRS’s SOI data.
There are average 1.8 shareholders per single S Corporation over time. The result shows that S Corporation is a small business with one or two shareholders.
<p>

<p>1. Wholesale and retail trade </p>
<p>2. Manufacturing </p>
<p>3. Professional, scientific, and technical services </p>
<p>4. Healthcare and social assistance.</p>
<p>
In addition, the finding shows that the following sectors are the top four sectors based on an advertising expense per their revenue over time.  
<p>1. Educational services</p>  
<p>2. Accommodation and food services</p>
<p>3. Real estate and rental and leasing</p> 
<p>4. Arts, entertainment, and recreation</p>
